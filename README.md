This Program is designed to help small businesses manage tasks assigned to each member of the team.
The program begins with a Login section where the user should be prompted to enter a username and password.

Once the user has succesfully logged in a menu is displayed with the following options.
- ‘r’ to register a user,
- ‘a’ to add a task,
- ‘va’ to view all tasks
- ‘vm’ to view the tasks that are assigned to them.

This program will work with two text files, user.txt and tasks.txt. 
tasks.txt stores a list of all the tasks that the team is working on.
user.txt stores the username and password for each user that has permission to use your program
